# My Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my software developer portfolio! This project showcases my work, skills, and projects through a dynamic, interactive web interface built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It also includes a contact form powered by [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/) for easy communication.

## Features

- **Next.js**: Utilises the power of server-side rendering and static site generation for fast, optimised performance.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: React Hooks are used to dynamically display content, providing a responsive and smooth user experience.
- **Navigation Header**: A custom header allows for easy navigation between sections, including Home, Projects, and Contact.
- **Projects Showcase**: Highlights my work, displaying individual projects with descriptions, demos, links, and key technologies used.
- **Contact Form**: A fully functional contact form built with Nodemailer that sends emails directly to me.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React.js, Typescript, CSS3
- **Backend**: Nodemailer (for contact form)
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Styling**: Styled Components / CSS Modules (whichever applies)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
